ADDICTION is a 2.5D top down action game.

In this game you control an airship while dealing with annoying pop-ups that want to take all your money.

With ADDICTION we want to show how monetization in videogames is making them to lose quality.

We have 2 types of duality here:
- Duality in gameplay, because you have to play a classic airship game but at the same time you have to deal with pop-ups like another different game.
- Duality in how game developers have to choose between monetization and fun gameplay. This game shows how monetization can make a game not fun.

And before you ask, yes, this game is gonna drive you crazy. Remind have fun with the airship and dont lose all your money ;)
